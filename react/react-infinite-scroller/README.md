In this project, I basically took the `infinite-scroll` project and re-implemented it using `react-infinite-scroller`.

TODO:
* Try this out in a child component, and see if you can get a wrapper component for this.
* Make a wrapper component that has render props for the following:
  * loader 
  * error message
  * render a single item.  Don't make me call a map function
