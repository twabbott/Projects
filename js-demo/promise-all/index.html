  <h1>Promise.all() Demo</h1>
  <p>
    In this demo I call a bunch of async functions and wait for them all to complete. 
    There is a 10% chance that one of the functions will fail.  If they all complete
    successfully then Promise.all() will return an array of results that corresponds
    to each promise function.  If any of the promises becomes rejected then Promise.all()
    returns undefined.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that if one of the async functions throws an exception, the others will still
    run to completion.  There is no way to abort a promise in JavaScript.
  </p>

    Refresh the page to re-run the demonstration.
